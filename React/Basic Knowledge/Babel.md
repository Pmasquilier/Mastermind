We call Babel a ==transpiler== that is a special type of compiling where source code written in one language is transformed into another language that has a similar level of abstraction.

==babel/core== is the core Babel library, which does the transpiling. The ==babel/preset-env== package is a preset that allows you to use modern JS without worrying about browser compatibility issues. The ==babel/preset-react== package exactly does the same thing but for [[JSX]] code. And the ==babel-loader== is a package that tells [[Webpack]] how to interpret and translate files before it does the bundling.
