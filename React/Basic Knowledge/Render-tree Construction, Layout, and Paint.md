# Render-tree Construction, Layout, and Paint
## Creation of Render Tree

After we've calculated which nodes should be visible and their computed styles, we have to calculated their exact position and size within theÂ viewport of the device---that's the =="layout"== stage, also known as =="reflow."==. The output of the layout process is a ==box model==

==box model== precisely captures the exact position and size of each element within the viewport: all of the relative measurements are converted to absolute ==pixels== on the screen.

When we have the ==box model==, we can convert each node in the render tree to actual pixels on the screen. This step is often referred to as =="painting"== .
