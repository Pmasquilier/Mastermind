## SPA ET MPAs
There are two kinds of applications: ==[[Single Page Application]]== and ==[[Multi-Page Apps (MPAs)]]==. In a ==single-page application (SPA)==, the browser gets only one page from the server and interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. You can use React for two purposes. One is to build ==SPAs==, where React controls the entire UI after the browser loaded the single page from the server. The other purpose is to control parts or widgets of a page in ==MPAs.==
