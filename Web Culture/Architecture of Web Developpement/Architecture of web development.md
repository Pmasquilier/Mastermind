Here are the major architectures (in chronological order of popular use):

1.  Multi-Page Apps (MPAs)
2.  Progressively Enhanced Multi-Page Apps (PEMPAs, aka “JavaScript Sprinkles”)
3.  Single Page Apps (SPAs)
4.  _The next transition_

As we cover each architecture, we’ll consider specifically the following use cases of code:

-   Persistence - saving and reading data from a database
-   Routing - directing traffic based on the URL
-   Data fetching - retrieving data from persistence
-   Data mutation - changing data in persistence
-   Rendering logic - displaying data to the user
-   UI Feedback - responding to user interaction
