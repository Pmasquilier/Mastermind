**What is ASCII ?** **How many values does it represents and what are they ?** :: 
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet. In standard ASCII-encoded data, there are unique values for 128 alphabetic, numeric or special additional characters and control codes.

Characters in ASCII encoding include upper- and lowercase letters A through Z, numerals 0 through 9 and basic punctuation symbols.

ASCII characters may be represented in the following ways:
- as pairs of hexadecimal digits -- base-16 numbers, represented as 0 through 9 and A through F for the decimal values of 10-15;
- as three-digit octal (base 8) numbers;
- as decimal numbers from 0 to 127; or
- as 7-bit or 8-bit binary

For example, the ASCII encoding for the lowercase letter "m" is represented in the following ways:
