What is Unicode ? Whose successor is it? What are the 3 most common encodings for storing unicode ?:: 
Unicode is a modern standard for text representation that defines each of the letters and symbols commonly used in todayâ€™s digital and print media. Unicode has become the top standard for identifying characters in text in nearly any language.

Developed in the 1980s, Unicode represented a step toward a more global strategy for text representation than the previously used American Standard Code for Information Interchange ([[ASCII]]).

Unicode can be stored using several different encodings, which translate the character codes into sequences of bytes. The Unicode standard defines three and several other encodings exist, all in practice variable-length encodings. The most common encodings are the **ASCII-compatible UTF-8**, the **ASCII-incompatible UTF-16** (compatible with the obsolete UCS-2), and the Chinese Unicode encoding standard **GB18030**.
